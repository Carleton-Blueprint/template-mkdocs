# [**Server.pro**](https://server.pro) Sponsorship Proposal

![serverpro_banner](serverpro_banner.webp)

## Introduction

[**Carleton Blueprint**](https://cublueprint.org) is a student-run non-for-profit organization dedicated to supporting **other non-profits** by offering **pro-bono tech solutions**, for free.

This is accomplished by recruiting and training volunteer student developers for each project that is taken on.

!!! note "Values"
    This model operates with the goal of ^^**maximizing value to all parties involved**^^. For example:

    - ==Student developers== are exposed to **hands-on training** and real-world software development experience in these projects.
    - ==Non-profit organizations== achieve increased **technical sophistication** by laying out functional and non-functional requirements.

### About the work

Many of Blueprint‚Äôs solutions involve the use of **web development** technologies and frameworks, such as *Next.js, React.js, Node, PostgreSQL, Astro, Gatsby, Django,* etc.

Starting 2024, Blueprint strives to uphold the values of the [==^^**open source software movement**^^==](https://www.gnu.org/gnu/manifesto.en.html) by publishing our work for free on the Blueprint GitHub organization, which contains a non-exhaustive list of our past projects:

[**üîó Carleton Blueprint ‚Äì¬†GitHub Organization**](https://github.com/Carleton-Blueprint/)

## Sponsorship Opportunities

- **`Server.pro.collab(new Blueprint())`**

To support the development phase of Blueprint‚Äôs projects, we make use of various resources to host **preview deployments** of each project for rigorous testing and product verification.

Due to budgetary constraints, Blueprint project teams have historically relied on **local solutions**, or by distributing deployments to various, scattered platforms which offer free but limited support.

With this collaboration, we aim to establish a **long-term partnership** with **Server.pro** to provide Blueprint with **Vitual Private Servers (VPS)** for hosting Blueprint projects over the duration of the project developement lifecycle *(typically 3-6 months per project)*.

### Example Use Cases

Below is a ==non-normative== list of some frequently-used technologies that may be deployed on Server.pro servers:

## Benefits of Sponsoring

### Website Feature

:   [üîó cublueprint.org](https://cublueprint.org) is Blueprint's primary landing page that students and non-profits frequently visit to view current events and hiring opportunities at a high frequency.
:   A new **"Sponsors"** section/page will be created just for Server.pro üéâ! Server.pro will be featured prominently on the main landsing site: [üîó Carleton Blueprint Website](https://cublueprint.org), along with other sponsors to come.

### Recognition on Client Handover Emails

:   `Enjoyed the reliability of our servers? Thank Server.pro! ‚ù§Ô∏è` ‚Äì Server.pro will be mentioned in the client handover emails that are sent out to non-profit organizations **at the end of each project**.

: Clients will retain the freedom to select their own hosting provider after the project is handed over, *as Blueprint takes no responsibility for the hosting of the project after the handover*. However, **should the client choose to continue using Server.pro**, Blueprint developers will be available to assist in ==worry-free migrations to the clients' own Server.pro accounts üí™==.

### Exposure to the Blueprint Community

:   Server.pro will be featured in the Blueprint Discord server, which is used by Blueprint developers to communicate and collaborate on projects.

## In-Kind Sponsorship Details

The table above illustrates the proposed itemized costs per month for the sponsorship. The total cost per month is **$34**.

!!! abstract "Long Term Horizontal/Vertical Infrastucture Scaling"
    As Blueprint grows, the number of projects and developers will increase. This will require a **horizontal scaling** of the infrastructure to support the increased number of projects. Additionally, as the complexity of the projects increases, the infrastructure will need to be **vertically scaled** to support the increased resource requirements of the projects.

    In time, should Blueprint request additional resources from Server.pro, it shall do so with ==referral analysis== and justification of the increased resource requirements based on collected data to measure the **effectiveness/efficiency** of the marketing campaign.


## Termination Clause

In the event that either party wishes to terminate the sponsorship, a **30-day notice** must be given to the other party. This will allow both parties to make the necessary arrangements to ensure a smooth transition.

## Contact Information

{{ read_csv('contact.csv') }}

Blueprint has `admin@server.pro` as the primary contact for all sponsorship-related inquiries on-file. If this information is incorrect, please let us know so we can update our records.
